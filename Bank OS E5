Simple Summary: Bank Onboarding System Specification
What This Is
A detailed guide for building a bank customer onboarding system (the process of signing up new customers). It tells developers exactly what parts are needed and how they should work together.

Main Goal
Make sure the system is secure, follows bank rules, and customers can't do things they shouldn't be able to do (like accessing someone else's account).

How It Works (The Basic Flow)
Customer starts: Signs up and provides consent
Customer provides proof: Uploads ID documents and takes a face recognition test
System checks: Validates documents and face proof
If something looks wrong: A bank employee reviews it
Customer approves: Reviews and approves the process
Bank approves: A bank employee signs off (with a second employee checking it)
Account created: The system creates the actual bank account
Key Safety Features
Maker/Checker rule: For high-risk customers, two bank employees must approve (reduces fraud)
Only customers can approve their own process: They can't execute anything by themselves
Approvals expire: Approvals have time limits
Everything is logged: Every action is recorded for security audits
Failed attempts tracked: System knows if documents are bad quality or face tests fail
Main System Parts
Journey Tracker: Follows the customer through each step
Policy Engine: Decides if documents/face tests are good enough
Back-Office Queue: Manages review tasks for bank employees
Audit Logger: Records everything that happened
Evidence Storage: Stores documents and face capture data
What Gets Tested
Does the system follow the correct step-by-step flow?
Are decisions (approvals/rejections) working correctly?
Can bank employees properly review and approve?
Is everything properly recorded in logs?
What happens when things fail (bad uploads, network errors)?
In short: This is a blueprint for a secure, auditable customer signup system where both the customer and the bank have control checks built in.
