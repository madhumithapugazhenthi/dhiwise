BankOS SAE Contract – Simple Explanation
Think of it as a three-step safety process for any important banking action:

The Three Steps
Simulate (Plan)

Someone proposes an action (e.g., "transfer $1,000 to another account")
The system analyzes it on paper—no actual money moves
It shows: what would happen, what risks exist, who needs to approve it
This is safe because nothing actually changes yet
Approve (Get Permission)

The right person (manager, customer, etc.) explicitly says "yes, do it"
This approval is recorded so we can audit it later
It's specific: "I approve THIS action, for THIS amount, by THIS date"
Critical rule: Approval never executes automatically—it's just permission
Execute (Actually Do It)

Only after approval, the bank's core system performs the action
Money moves, accounts update, records change
This step is irreversible (if something goes wrong, you compensate, not undo)
The Core Rule
No action happens without explicit, documented approval. You can't guess, assume, or infer approval—it must be written down.

Who Does What
AI / Chatbot: Can simulate and explain. CANNOT approve or execute.
Back-office staff: Can simulate and approve (within their role limits)
Customer: Approves their own actions
Core banking system: Performs the final execution
BankOS: Orchestrates and enforces the rules
Key Safeguards
If approval is missing → DENY the action
If there's a policy conflict → BLOCK and escalate to a human
Everything is audited → who did what, when, and why
In essence: Propose safely → Get permission explicitly → Execute once approved. Nothing sneaks through without oversight.
