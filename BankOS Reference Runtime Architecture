Simple Summary: How BankOS Is Built and Runs
What This Describes
This is the blueprint for how a banking system (BankOS) should be structured and operated. It explains how all the pieces fit together from a single developer's laptop to a large enterprise setup—without changing the core design.

Core Idea: Everything in One Box
Instead of splitting the system into many separate services (microservices), BankOS is one application running in one process. Think of it like having all bank departments in one building rather than scattered across the city. This makes it:

Simpler to understand
Easier to control
Faster (no network delays between parts)
Safer (easier to audit)
How It Works
The Modular Monolith Approach:

Everything runs together in one program
Different parts (customer journeys, ledger, documents, risk checks) have clear boundaries
Parts talk to each other instantly (function calls, no internet involved)
All pieces follow the same rules
The SAE Rule Still Applies:

Simulate: System shows what would happen (no actual changes)
Approve: A human or policy says "OK, do it"
Execute: System actually makes the change
This rule is enforced for every important action
How AI Fits In
AI agents run inside the same application (not separate)
AI can suggest actions and simulate outcomes
AI cannot approve or execute things by itself
Everything AI does is logged and auditable
Key Safety Features
No sneaky changes: Every action requires approval
Separated duties: Important approvals need two people (maker/checker)
Complete record: Everything is logged for audits
Policy enforcement: Rules prevent unauthorized actions
Fail-safe defaults: If something goes wrong, the system blocks action and asks for help
How It Scales
On Your Laptop (Development):

One copy of the app runs locally
Everything works the same as production
All safety rules apply
In a Big Bank (Production):

Many copies of the app run simultaneously
They share the same database/ledger (external system)
Each copy is replaceable and stateless
No architectural changes needed
What Stays External
The system does not store actual money or account data itself. Instead:

It makes decisions and approvals
It sends instructions to the actual bank systems
The bank systems confirm what actually happened
The app coordinates everything
What This Avoids
❌ Breaking into many separate microservices
❌ AI making decisions without approval
❌ Hidden shortcuts that skip safety checks
❌ Internal network calls between parts
❌ Different behavior on laptop vs production
In Plain English
BankOS is designed to be one coordinated application that you can run on your computer or scale to handle millions of transactions—all while keeping strict control over who can do what and recording everything that happens.
